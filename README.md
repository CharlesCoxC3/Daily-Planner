# Daily-Planner
Daily Planning App

## Description
Was asked to build an application where my client could schedule events and save their events. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
The application can save texts input into the textarea, and will also save those inputs into local storage once the save button is pressed. On refresh the local storage will display what was saved last. Also you can reset everything entered with the reset button. And lastly the color of the textarea will change color based on the time of day. If its the current hour(green), past(red), future(grey).
